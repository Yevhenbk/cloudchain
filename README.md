# Cloudchain

Cloudchain is a web application where you can transfer crypto assets all around the globe. Once you 
enter a page you'll be welcomed to connect your Metamask wallet, and, right after, you'll be redirected to 
your digital wallet. Digital wallet is exactly where all the action is happenning - you'll see your digital card 
that will show your account address and its balance, along with it a modal, which will allow you to perform a transaction, and 
a list of your latest transactions.



 The project is made in Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS with cva and clsx for styliing.
